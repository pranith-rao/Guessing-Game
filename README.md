# Guessing-Game
This is a Simple Guessing game created using python socket module as my CN Project. 
The game is that 2 players will join the server, one will enter 2 statements one correct and one incorrect and the other player has to guess it. And this can be continued till a target score mutually decided by both the players is reached to decide the winner. Interesting right!

# Steps to run the game
1. Once you have the files in your local machine open it using VS code or anyother editor of your choice.\
2. Open the terminal and type 'py server.py' and press enter. The game server has started.\
3. Now split the terminal and type 'py client.py' and press enter. This makes player 1 to join the server.\
4. Player 1 will be promted to enter the correct and incorrect statements.\
5. Once its done split the terminal again and in the new terminal type 'py client.py' again. Now this makes player 2 to join the server.\
6. Player 2 will be have 2 statements displayed out of which he has to guess the correct one. He has to enter 1 or 2 based on his predictions and the server will respond whether it's the correct answer or not with the respective message.\
7. Just make sure that server is running throught the game.(From step 3 to step 6)\
8. Enjoy guessing!
